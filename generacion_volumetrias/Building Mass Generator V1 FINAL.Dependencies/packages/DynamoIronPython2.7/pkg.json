While there are differences in language the Python basis is the same and we have provided a Migration Assistant to help you migrate your code to Python3.","group":"","keywords":["python","ironpython"],"dependencies":[],"host_dependencies":["Revit","Civil 3D","Alias","Advance Steel","FormIt"],"contents":"","engine_version":"3.1.0.3411","engine":"dynamo","engine_metadata":"","site_url":"https://dynamobim.org/","repository_url":"https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo","contains_binaries":true,"node_libraries":["DSIronPythonEmpty, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"],"copyright_holder":"DynamoTeam","copyright_year":"2024"}
